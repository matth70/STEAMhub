  <h2>Leprechaun Trap Activity</h2>
  <img src="img/leprechaun.png" class="leprechaunImg">
	<p class="leprechaunText">
    <u>Focus Areas</u><br><br>
• Pest Control – Mechanical Science<br>
• Language Arts Focus Skills: critical and creative thinking, listening to learn information, oral
speaking<br>
• Engineering Skills: problem solving, cooperative interacting<br>
What is criteria for a successful trap?<br>
What is needed to make a good (leprechaun) trap?<br>
Before you build a trap, you have to learn about the creature you are trapping! A successful trap; must be the right size must use the right bait must provide no way to escape must be placed in the right location may need to hold, but not harm the creature....(this is essential in teaching students about sustainability and helping others to maintain quality of life).<br><br>
<u>Background</u><br><br>
Traps are mechanical pest control devices. Whether capturing mice or leprechauns, the criterion for a successful trap is the same. The trap must be large enough to attract the prey, hold it captive, and finally prevent escape. The correct location is also important.<br>
The principals and purpose of traps can be discussed within the context of “Let’s pretend.” Designing a trap for a fanciful creature will delight the children while providing opportunities for both critical and creative thinking. If you provide material to draw they can also explore what their design will potentially look like.<br><br>
<u>Vocabulary</u><br><br>
• Bait: a color, smell, or thing that will attract the desired prey<br>
• Leprechaun: according to the Irishman magical wee person who likes to play tricks on people, but
if captured will either grant three wishes or give you his gold!<br>
• Mechanical control: a device (thing) and/or physical action used to control someone or something<br>
• Prey: the creature being hunted<br>
• Trap: a mechanical device (thing) used to capture prey<br><br>
<u>Activity</u><br><br>
Students will work in groups to design and build a safe humane trap to catch a Leprechaun. They will take turns being:<br>
• Project manager<br>
• Inventory specialist<br>
• Research and development<br>
• Building manager<br>
The sustainability of the prey must be considered at all times.......Have fun!<br>
• How this lesson involves productive teamwork: Stage 1, 2 Leadership<br>
o Helping students work together as a productive team is never an easy job. It becomes exponentially easier if all STEM teachers at a school work together to implement teamwork, using the same language, procedures, and expectations for students. This helps when building specific student-teamwork skills and focuses on stage 1 (leading yourself) and stage 2 (small groups) leadership procedures.<br>
• STEM lessons focus on real-world issues and problems Stage 3, 4 Leadership<br>
o In this STEAM lesson, students address real social, economic, and environmental problems and seek solutions. This helps the address stage 3 leadership (leading large groups). As well as focus on how what we do affects not only the world directly around us but also issues affecting the world as a whole and how we can reach others to help possibly make a difference (teaching leadership to others).
