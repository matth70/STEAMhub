  <h2>DIY Calorimeter</h2>
<p class="calorieText">
  "Bomb calorimeter" sounds a bit confusing – it can also be called a "combustion calorimeter."<br> The sample is placed in a small metal container and lit, or combusted, so it burns up.
   The heat from the sample is transferred to the can and then to the water.<br> The temperature difference of the water is measured from start to finish. A larger temperature difference means that more energy was transferred. <br><br>
  In food, intrinsic energy is measured in Calories, with a capital C. A Calorie is 1000 calories, with a lower case c. A calorie is the amount of energy it takes to heat 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius. Our bodies are burning up large amounts of energy from food every day and every night! Calorimetry is the study of finding the amount of energy in a material.  Determine which nuts and other snack foods contains the most energy. What type of snack will produce the most energy –Why?
<br><br><p>1. Fill the jug or large container with water and let it sit while you build your calorimeter. It should be room temperature by the time you have to use it.<br> 2. Insert the eye of the needle into the smaller end of the cork. Be careful of the sharp end!<br> 3. Using the can opener, cut off the top and bottom of the large can. Aluminum can be very sharp after cutting, so be wary of the edges. Wash it out and let it dry.<br> 4. Using the drill or the hammer and nail, punch some holes around the perimeter of the bottom of the large can. Why do the holes need to be at the bottom of the can?<br> 5. Using the can opener, cut off the top of the metal can. Wash it out and let it dry.<br> 6. Using the drill or the hammer and nail, create two holes directly across from each other about ½-inch above the open end of the can.<br> 7. Insert the metal rod or skewer into the holes in the small can.<br> 8. Tape the metal rod over the top opening of the large can, the side with no holes. The small can will hang down inside the larger can.<br> 9. Place the thermometer in the small can.<br> 10. Pour half a cup of water into the small can. Be sure the amount of water in the can is the same for each trial. Why is it important that the amount of water in the can is the same?<br> 11. Select a snack food and weigh it on the food scale. Record the weight.<br> 12. Carefully insert the sharp end of the needle into the snack.<br> 13. Place the larger end of the cork on a non-flammable counter top with the snack facing up.<br> 14. Light the snack with a lighter or a match. It may take a couple of tries to get the nut to stay lit. Take care not to burn yourself or your clothing!<br> 15. Quickly place the large can over the cork and snack. The small hanging can will be directly over the burning snack.<br>
  16. Record the beginning temperature of the water.<br> 17. Burn the snack until it goes out. Record the temperature of the water after the snack goes out and record any other observations in your notebook.<br></p>

  18. Discard the water in the can and fill it with another half cup from the room temperature jug. Repeat 10 trials per type of snack. This allows you to get a enough samples to get a good average. Which snack produces the greatest change in temperature?<br> 19. For each snack, calculate the change in temperature per weight of the snack. Why would the temperature change per weight matter? How can we calculate calories using this information? Hint: ½ a cup of water is equal to 118 grams.<br><br>
  Combustion, more commonly known as burning, combines a material with oxygen (which is actually very flammable!) and energy in to produce heat. This is what happens to the snack. The heat from the snack rises through the air and heats the can of water, then the temperature is measured. The holes at the bottom of the larger can insure that the heat rises upward, it acts like the chimney in a house. Without the holes, the large can would experience more of the heating. It is important that the same amount of water be used in the can for each trial because that is the standard by which you can compare the measurement. It is the control variable. Calculating calories: Change in degrees Celsius / grams of water = # of calories 100 * calories = # of Calories (food calories).</p>
